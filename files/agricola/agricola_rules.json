  "game_overview": "Agricola is an agricultural development game set in 17th Century Central Europe. Players start with a farming couple living in a simple two-roomed hut. During 14 rounds of gameplay, families work to improve their quality of life by building up their home, improving their fields, and breeding animals. Each Family member may take exactly one action per round, and each action can only be taken by one person per round. Players must carefully plan when to grow their family, manage resources, and ensure everyone is fed. Victory is determined by establishing the best farmyard through fields, pastures, animals, improvements, and family size.",
  "objective": "At the end of 14 rounds, the winner is the player who has established the best farmyard with the highest number of victory points. Points are awarded for fields, pastures, fenced stables, Grain, Vegetables, Sheep, Wild boar, Cattle, house type, Family members, and played Occupation and Improvement cards. Points are lost for unused farmyard spaces and Begging cards.",
