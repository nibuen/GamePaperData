    "game_overview": "Food Chain Magnate is a heavy strategy game about building a fast food chain. Players compete on a variable city map through purchasing, marketing and sales, and on a job market for key staff members. The focus is on building your company using a card-driven (human) resource management system. Each player starts as a single entrepreneur and builds up a fast food chain by hiring and training staff, represented by cards, and by running the operations of their company, which is done on a variable board. The game continues until the bank runs out of money twice. The richest player then wins.",
